##About 

I am an AI Engineer for a unicorn startup with experience working as a Database Developer, Data Analyst, and AI Researcher. My background in industries such as 
finance, defense, and healthcare, have made me well rounded in the data sphere. I love taking on new challenges and working on innovative projects. This page contains
some of the projects that I have worked on recently.
